# BUDGE: The budget and savings tracker

![The BUDGE terminal displayed on different devices](/assets/images/responsive-test.png)

- BUDGE is a handy tool where you can keep track of your monthly spending and saving. Whether you're saving for a house or a holiday, BUDGE provides a friendly push in the right direction by analysing your spending data and providing insights on how much you should be saving each month. 
        
- Start by entering your monthly incoming and outgoing and BUDGE will calculate your savings. After you've entered a few months data, why not set a saving goal and see how much you'll need to save each month in order to reach it?

## Strategy

### Target Audience
- Directed at those who wish to save some money or keep track of their monthly spending, this application will most likely attract those who are saving for a specific event/item or for those who are new to keeping track of their own finances, most likely teenagers and young adults, and need some guidance on how to set a budget.

### User Stories

*Individuals who are saving for a specific event or purchase, an end date and/or set amount is in mind*
- As a saver, I would like to be able to set a goal to work towards.
- As a saver, I would like guidance on how to reach my savings goal in the required timeframe.
- As a saver, I would like feedback on my progress towards my goal so that I may adjust my spending accordingly.

#### Budgeters
*Individuals who do not necessarily have a specific event ot purchase in mind but would like to set a budget for themselves to follow*
- As a budgeter, I would like to easily enter my monthly income and spending and calculate the difference.
